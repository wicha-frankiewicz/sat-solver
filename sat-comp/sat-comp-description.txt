SAT competition description

-------------------------------------------------------------
   21111 SAT Competition Rules 
-------------------------------------------------------------

In order to participate in the competition you need to:

- Implement a satisfiability solver for propositional logic which accepts problems 
  in clausal normal form in the DIMACS format.
  
  The implementation should be your own and 
  you should not copy code from other implementations but can borrow ideas. 

- You can implement any method for checking  propositional satisfiability: 
  given in the lectures (DPLL, GSAT, Walk SAT, ...), and/or based on your own ideas, 
  and/or researched from the Internet (e.g., CDCL also see extra materials).

 
- Input: the solver should accept problems from the standard input in 

 DIMACS CNF format. Example:

c comment line
c this is a test problem

p cnf 3 4

1 0
-1 2 0
-1 -2 3 0
-2 -3 0


  Where lines starting with  "c" are comment lines, you can ignore them.
  Line "p cnf 3 4" 
  indicates that there are 3 variables and 4 clauses in the problem.
  Literals are represented by numbers 1 is positive literal -1 negative literal   
  clauses are written as a sequence of literals separated by spaces, 
  each clause is written on one line terminated by "0".

- you can use any programming language, but your solver should be compilable 
  under Linux on the School lab computers using one command,
  you can use a Makefile or a bash script for this.
  
- Output: 
  solver's output should contain a result line which is one of:

SATISFIABLE
UNSATISFIABLE

UNKNOWN (optional)
  
- one should be able to run your solver with the following command line

    cat problem.cnf | your_solver_name 


- solver should be sound i.e. output only correct results, 
  but can be incomplete: it can output "UNKNOWN", or no result


- your code should be well documented with comments

------------------------------------------
 Testing evaluating your system using sat evaluation suite: sat-comp.zip

 Download sat-comp.zip
------------------------------------------

- unzip sat-comp.zip
  
- run 
  g-test <set> <out_dir> <solver-name>
  where <set>: simple, medium, hard
   
  For example if your solver is my_sat_solver then 
  
   g-test simple out_dir ./my_sat_solver

   should produce at the end somthing like: 

-----------------------------------------------------------------
input solver(s) sat: 129 avg. 0. unsat: 81 avg. 0. unknown: 0 killed: 0
"./my_solver" sat: 129 avg. 0. unsat: 81 avg. 0. unknown: 0 killed: 0
"./my_solver" better: 0 worse: 0 same: 210 inconsistencies: 0
-----------------------------------------------------------------

- If the number of "inconsistencies:" is not 0 then your solver produce worng results. 

  You can find the problematic problems by looking at the logs in the out_dir and 
  cnf of the needed problem in the directory sat_tests/simple sat_tests/medium or sat_tests/hard   

- If you have all problems are  "unknown:" then most likely your solver does not return correct output string 
  or does not accpet cnf in the stdin. 

You can try by hand e.g.: 

cat sat_tests/simple/prop_rnd_129735_v_3_c_12_vic_1_4.cnf | you_solver

should return:

UNSATISFIABLE

cat sat_tests/simple/prop_rnd_962258_v_5_c_21_vic_2_4.cnf | your_solver

should return:

SATISFIABLE

- hard problems were randomly generated by the method described in lectures whith the ratio of cluases to variables
  around the crossover point (4.25).

Submission instructions:
---------------------------------------

Submit zip with:
1) Sources of your solver
2) Executable runnable on CS Linux machines, with input/output described above 
3) Readme containing:
    a) Name of your solver and author(s)
    b) How to compile your solver using a single command line on the CS Linux machines (you can use "make" or bash scripts). 
    c) Short description which methods you implemented, which language you used, any optimisations that you found particularly useful.
    d) Evaluation directories small_out; medium_out; hard_out  containing your evaluation runs on the CS Linux computers (with 30s timeout).
    e) If you are agree for your solver and name to be included in the evaluation table put on Canvas course page.
